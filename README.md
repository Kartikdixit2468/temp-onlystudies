# OnlyStudies 🎓✨

Turn Text into Educational Animations in Minutes.

OnlyStudies is an AI-powered platform that converts simple text descriptions into high-quality, 3-minute educational videos. It automates the entire animation pipeline—from scriptwriting to rendering—making complex concepts like Quantum Entanglement or Bubble Sort easy to understand through visual storytelling.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Video Pipeline**: Generates a complete 3-minute lesson without human intervention.
- **Intelligent Structuring**: Enforces a proven pedagogical format (Theory, Analogy, Example).

- **Smart Stitching**: Solves the AI "context window" limit by generating 3 separate scenes and stitching them into one seamless MP4.
- **Sleek UX**: A dark-mode, responsive interface with real-time terminal logs and Lottie loading animations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **AI Logic**: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (via google-generativeai)
- **Animation Engine**: Manim Community Edition
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg & MoviePy
